# About the Dataset

## Context

This is the **Sentiment140 dataset**. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the Twitter API. The tweets have been annotated with sentiment labels (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and can be used for sentiment detection.

## Content

The dataset includes the following 6 fields:

- **target:** The polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)

- **date:** The date of the tweet (e.g., Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
- **flag:** The query (e.g., lyx). If there is no query, this value is NO_QUERY.
- **user:** The user who tweeted (e.g., robotickilldozr)
- **text:** The text of the tweet (e.g., Lyx is cool)
